## Research Question

> *Hypothesis:* There are socio-spatial disparities in 311 reporting

> *Implications:* This leads to unfairness in local government response that perpetuates lack of attention for underserved/neglected communities.

Are there disparities, at the Census block level, in 311 reporting? If so, do these translate to disparities in government response?
