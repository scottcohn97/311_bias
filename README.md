Bias in 311 Response
================

This repo contains the code and data for reproducing *Bias in 311
Response*.

> **Abstract:** This paper explores the interaction between citizen
> satisfaction in local government with 311 service usage, and related
> bias in who may be using these services more. I combine open-access
> data on 311 service usage and property violations from KCMO OpenData
> with Census data, and a proprietary citizen satisfaction survey
> conducted by the Kansas City Office of Performance Management. I find
> that certain demographics like gender, race, and income affect
> likelihood of contacting city services, but the strongest predictors
> of 311 usage are pre-existing and regular interactions with city
> services — like recycling, visiting parks, and visiting the city
> website.

> **Keywords:** 311 Complaint, City governance, Classification, Bias

## Software

The analysis for this project was conducted in *R*.

## Problems

I cannot upload the citizen satisfaction survey data per my agreement
with the Kansas City Office of Performance Management. All other code
should run. Please contact me if you wish to run my code.

If you have any trouble running the code, or find any errors, please
file an issue and I’ll look into it.
